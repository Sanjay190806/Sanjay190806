## 🛠️ NeuroApp SDK - Developer Platform

### **What is NeuroApp SDK?**

NeuroApp SDK is a **comprehensive toolkit** enabling developers worldwide to build applications on top of Linkware—similar to how iOS SDK enables iPhone apps.

Think of it as the "AppStore for brain-controlled applications."

**🔗 [View NeuroApp SDK Documentation](https://docs.neuroapp.linkware.tech)**

### **Why NeuroApp SDK Matters**

**Unlocks 1000x Innovation:**
- 10,000+ developers building apps
- Exponential innovation acceleration
- Network effects: more apps → more users → more data → better AI
- Open ecosystem approach
- Developer-driven feature discovery

### **Core Components**

**1. JavaScript/Python API Library**

from neuroapp import LinkwareClient, Gestures

class SmartHomeApp:
def init(self):
self.linkware = LinkwareClient(api_key="YOUR_KEY")

@self.linkware.gesture("blink")
def on_blink(self):
    self.toggle_light()

@self.linkware.gesture("double_blink")
def on_double_blink(self):
    self.toggle_fan()

@self.linkware.gesture("wink_left")
def on_wink_left(self):
    self.brightness_up()

@self.linkware.gesture("wink_right")
def on_wink_right(self):
    self.brightness_down()



**2. Real-Time Event Streaming**

from neuroapp import LinkwareStream

stream = LinkwareStream(api_key="YOUR_KEY")

@stream.on("neural_event")
def handle_neural_event(event):
print(f"Gesture: {event.type}, Confidence: {event.confidence}%")

stream.start() # Listen forever


**3. Custom ML Training**

from neuroapp import NeuralTrainer

trainer = NeuralTrainer()

Collect 50 samples of custom gesture
for i in range(50):
gesture_data = capture_neural_data(duration=2)
trainer.add_sample("my_custom_gesture", gesture_data)

Train on local device
trainer.train()

Deploy to Linkware device
trainer.deploy("my_app_gesture")

App now recognizes your custom gesture!
